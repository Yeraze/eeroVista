## Pending Features

(No pending features at this time)

## Completed
- [x] Multi-Network Support - v2.0.0 (2025-10-23)
  - Full multi-network data collection and filtering across entire application
  - Database schema: Added network_name column to all tables with composite unique constraints
  - Migration system: Created structured migration runner with version tracking
  - Migration 001: Added network_name to 8 tables with proper indexes
  - Migration 002: Updated unique constraints from single-column to composite (network_name + column)
  - Migration 003: Fixed routing table constraints (ip_reservations composite unique index)
  - Migration 004: Intelligent network assignment correction via MAC address matching with Eero API
    - Automatically runs after first successful authentication via retry mechanism
    - Tracks skipped auth-dependent migrations and retries them post-authentication
    - Corrects legacy data by matching devices/nodes between database and current API state
    - Preserves historical data: updates device_id references via MAC matching before cleanup
    - **Preserves aliases**: copies DNS aliases from old devices to new devices before deletion
    - Tested with production database: 682,850 connections + 392 bandwidth records + 4 devices with aliases preserved âœ“
    - Prevents duplicate devices by skipping 'default' updates, deleting them after reference updates
  - Collectors: Updated device, network, speedtest, and routing collectors for multi-network support
  - API endpoints: Added optional ?network= query parameter to 20+ endpoints with backward compatibility
  - Frontend: Functional network selector dropdown with localStorage persistence across all pages

  - Nodes page: Per-network Eero device listing
  - Tested with 2 networks: Yoder (100 devices) + GauntletN-5G (71 devices) = 171 total
    - Migrated production database with 682,850+ historical connection records
    - Automated migration 004 correctly assigned legacy data to proper networks

- [x] Device manufacturer field support (2025-10-21)
  - Added manufacturer field to Device database model
  - Updated device collector to store manufacturer from Eero API
  - Enhanced device name fallback chain: nickname â†’ hostname â†’ manufacturer â†’ mac_address
  - Updated Device Details popup to show individual name fields (Nickname, Hostname, Manufacturer)
  - Added database migration for existing users (automatically runs on startup)
  - Fixes devices showing MAC addresses instead of readable manufacturer names (e.g., "Oculus VR, LLC")
- [x] Improved bandwidth formatting for small values (2025-10-21)
  - Updated formatBytes() to show KB for values < 1 MB (e.g., "30.72 KB" instead of "0.03 MB")
  - Added Bytes display for values < 1 KB
  - Updated chart y-axis labels to use smart formatting (automatically shows GB/MB/KB/Bytes)
  - Changed y-axis title from "Data Usage (MB)" to "Data Usage" for accuracy
  - Fixes devices with low bandwidth showing misleading "0 MB" values
- [x] Chart data completeness and hourly view fixes (2025-10-21)
  - Fixed device bandwidth endpoint to return full date range (7/30 days) with zeros for missing data
  - Fixed device hourly chart to show only today's data (UTC timezone parsing issue)
  - Aligned Device Details popup bandwidth charts with Dashboard implementation
  - Added incomplete data indicator (lighter colors for today's data)
  - Added category scale to prevent "Invalid date" x-axis issues
  - Added "(incomplete)" notation in tooltips for today's data
  - Added `is_incomplete` flag to device bandwidth endpoint matching network endpoint
  - Corrected collection interval calculation from 60s to 30s
  - Fixed UTC timestamp parsing by appending 'Z' suffix for correct timezone conversion
  - Ensures consistent chart behavior across Dashboard and Device Details views
- [x] v0.9.0 Release - IP reservations and port forwards tracking (PR #23)

  - Fixed bandwidth chart date range (now shows full requested range with zeros for missing days)
  - Redesigned device popup: 2x wider (1000px), full-width graph at top, 2-column layout below
  - No database migrations required
- [x] Hourly bandwidth endpoint optimization (PR #21)
  - SQL aggregation optimization: reduced query time from 3.0s to 2.3s (23% improvement)
  - In-memory caching with 5-minute TTL: cached requests now 0.003s (99.9% faster)
  - Overall: 1000x speedup for dashboard refresh scenarios
  - Enhanced Zabbix test suite: 13 unit tests + 20 integration test stubs
- [x] v0.7.1 Release - Zabbix 6.0+ templates with auto-discovery (PR #20)
